# Rockbuster Stealth LLC: Global BI Strategy
### 📊 SQL-Driven Business Intelligence for Market Expansion

---

## 🎯 Business Context
Rockbuster Stealth LLC, a former global leader in physical movie rentals, is undergoing a digital transformation to compete with streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon Prime. 

As part of the **Business Intelligence team**, my mission was to analyze legacy data to identify high-value markets, customer demographics, and inventory performance. This analysis serves as the strategic foundation for the launch of their new online video service.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack & Skills
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (Relational Database Management)
* **Language:** SQL (Complex Joins, Subqueries, CTEs, and Window Functions)
* **Visualization:** Tableau (Interactive Storyboarding)
* **Analysis:** Data Cleaning, EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), and Strategic Reporting

## 📂 Data Architecture
The project involved managing a comprehensive relational database with a snowflake schema:
* **Fact Tables:** `Payment`, `Rental`.
* **Dimension Tables:** `Film`, `Actor`, `Customer`, `Address`, `City`, `Country`, `Inventory`, `Category`, etc.
* **Scope:** Handling multi-country data to extract actionable insights for global stakeholders.

## 🚀 Key Business Questions Addressed
Using SQL, I extracted data to answer critical management questions:
1.  **Market Potential:** Which countries and cities contribute most to the revenue?
2.  **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV):** Who are the top-tier customers and where are they located?
3.  **Inventory Strategy:** Which movie genres and ratings are the most popular across different regions?
4.  **Sales Performance:** Identification of key revenue drivers and rental patterns.

## 📈 Strategic Results & Visualizations
The final analysis was translated into a data-driven strategy for the executive team.
